Since then, Taiwan has improved its pandemic preparedness by creating the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC, 中央流行疫情指揮中心) and adopting legislation that allows authorities to adjust border policies or place citizens under mandatory quarantine in the event of a health crisis, he added.',\n",

       " 'It is precisely those vaccines that are now “Taiwan’s Achilles’ heel,” he lamented.',\n",
       " 'In early May, Taiwan experienced its first major outbreak. At the height of the wave, Taiwan had about five hundred daily infections out of 23.5 million people. That might not sound much compared to other countries but, knowing that Taiwan’s vaccination rate is extremely low, Chen remarked that the vaccine shortage could last for months.',\n",

       " 'Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Taiwan Root Medical Peace Corps (TRMPC) is still doing all that they can within Taiwan to help people in need. The NGO is scheduled to head out to Mount Ali in Chiayi County to provide temporary medical care for indigenous groups on Aug. 15, in one of their first trips since the pandemic started. Since 1995, TRMPC, a private, non-government and non-profit organization, has brought short-term medical clinics to Taiwan mountainous regions and underdeveloped countries around the world. In 2003, it joined “the Conference of Non-governmental Organizations in Consultative Relationship with the United Nations CONGO” as the only Taiwanese NGO.',\n",
       " 'Funded by Dr. Liu Chi-chun, the TRMPC has done 390 medical missions in 49 countries globally with the help of over 17,000 volunteers. Each volunteer pays for their own transportation and necessities, while Dr. Liu covers everything else. Although the organization did receive NGO funds for a few years, the required payments were mostly paid by Dr. Liu, his team, and considerate donors.',\n",
       " '“Safety” and “security” are crucial to Dr. Liu. He always pre-visits the locations to review the safety level for his team and he strongly regards his work as something not to feel self-righteous about. “Everyone wants to help those in need. If you have the chance to volunteer, you should be grateful that your expertise helped save lives.”',\n",
       " '“Twenty-five years ago,” Dr. Liu sai: “I came across the newspaper that stated urgent help was needed in Jianshi Township, Hsinchu County and so, I went. That’s how Taiwan Root began. It was as simple as that.”',\n",
       " 'From the outset, the TRMPC focused on the indigenous populations in Taiwan’s mountain regions. Horrendous traffic conditions, poverty and an overall lower standard of living made them vulnerable to chronic health problems. On one medical mission, a volunteering couple heading to Hsinchu had to take two separate vehicles so that, in case one car gets into trouble, the other could still go and help patients.',\n",
       " 'International missions are often for places where poverty or natural disasters hit hard, meaning local populations do not have sufficient medical supplies. In 2002, Dr. Liu brought 45 volunteers to the Amazon River Basin. Among the many patients, Dr. Liu specifically recalled a frantic mother who brought her ill son to the TRMPC clinic.',\n",
       " 'The local doctors had told her that they couldn’t save her son and should bring him back home to wait for the inevitable. Devastated, the mother heard about Dr. Liu’s temporary clinic and begged for them to save her son. The TRMPC team examined the boy and found an infection from a splinter in his neck that caused inflammation. After removing the piece of wood, the volunteers gave the boy antibiotics, ultimately leading to his full recovery.',\n",
       " 'This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected TRMPC’s work, with all trips abroad halted. Even though Dr. Liu and his team want to help foreign countries in need of medical care, he is adamant to be loyal to his responsibilities: if he can’t guarantee the safety of his team at any given location, he will not bring any volunteers.',\n",
       " 'Volunteers come from all ages and backgrounds. As long as you are healthy, you are qualified to register via Taiwan Root’s website for all 18 projects (12 domestic and 6 international) on April 1 at noon annually.

       " 'Case 481 had worn a face mask, protective clothing, safety goggles and gloves for the duration of the returning trip to Taiwan and immediately reported his symptoms upon arrival, the CECC said.He was taken to an isolation facility to be tested by health authorities and his symptoms continued till Aug. 11; his infection was confirmed today.The man is now being quarantined at a local hospital.',\n",

Amid the ongoing outbreak, the nomination of Dr. Wu Ming-shiang to lead the NTUH on Aug. 1 has again attracted global media coverage.Speaking to The China Post, Taiwan in an exclusive interview, Dr. Wu praised the way Taiwan authorities have handled the pandemic so far. At the same time, he thanked Taiwan public for cooperating with health authorities while wearing face masks, washing their hands and keeping proper social distances. In facing this unprecedented pandemic, Dr. Wu remarked that many have come to realize that “prevention is better than the cure.”',\n",
       " 'Against this backdrop, Dr. Wu noted that “the pandemic is a crisis, but it is also an opportunity.”To this end, he aims to further assist the NTUH in putting greater efforts in developing “smart healthcare,” “precision health” and “advanced medicine” for the years to come.',\n",
       " 'Thanks to Taiwan’s strong IT industry, he expressed hopes to further incorporate technology and medical care too; thus, creating a “smart healthcare” that will benefit the people of Taiwan.',\n",
       " '“Prevention is the key to precision health,” said Dr. Wu who noted that Taiwan is doing so well on tertiary prevention (trying to improve your quality of life and reduce the symptoms of a disease you already have). Vast sums of medical expenses could also be saved if the primary (trying to prevent yourself from getting a disease) and secondary preventions (trying to detect a disease early and prevent it from getting worse) were reinforced too, he pointed out.',\n",
       " 'In this regard, Dr. Wu noted that the COVID-19 pandemic could be viewed as an opportunity for the development of future medical care in Taiwan. Prior to the pandemic, people neglected the concept of disease prevention, he went on, assuming that hospitals are a panacea for their health. Yet, hospitals have their limits, he pointed out. Under the threat of the coronavirus, people have begun to put more emphasis on health and have better understood the significance of disease prevention, he continued.',\n",
       " 'Countries have also been pouring more effort into vaccine development, elevating vaccine research to a national-security level issue, which he called “positive developments.” Given that the NTUH is the leading medical institution in Taiwan and the fourth medical center in the world that managed to isolate the coronavirus virus strain earlier this year, Dr. Wu said he is confident in the NTUH’s contribution to solving this global health crisis.',\n",
       " 'Yet, he lamented about the limited scale of the pharmaceutical industry and the size of Taiwan’s population, placing the eventual development of a local vaccine in a predicament.The Taiwanese research teams are likely to sell their research results to big international pharmaceutical companies even if the first and second vaccine trials go well, he explained. The difficulty of vaccine development also arose due to the low number of confirmed cases in Taiwan, he added.',\n",
       " 'So, why not wait for the U.S. to develop the vaccines? The problem is that the U.S wouldn’t export any vaccines until after its domestic needs are satisfied, Dr. Wu said.',\n",
       " 'More importantly, vaccine research is more than a competition; it is also a matter of “national security,” he continued. If a country fails to flatten the curve, it could ultimately cause crippling effects on the medical system, the economy, and our day-to-day lives, he warned.',\n",
       " 'Against such backdrop, Dr. Wu stressed the importance ofthe ADIMMUNE Corporation (國光生技), NTUH, which is involved in several clinical trials, including the Remdesivir trial led by Gilead Sciences (吉利德公司) in Taiwan.',\n",
       " 'In facing the pandemic, the NTUH adheres to the core value “all lives are invaluable” and “treat patients like family,” he explained. The NTUH will continue to do research and cultivate talents, aiming to become a prestigious international university hospital, he stressed.',\n",
       " 'Political leaders in Taiwan have done an amazing job in keeping Taiwan safe during this dire situation, and thus people have expressed concerns regarding their health.When asked about President Tsai’s health amid the global health crisis, Dr. Wu emphasized that despite having the best healthcare personnel to attend to her, the president is always “conscious of her virus-prevention actions” whenever she steps outside the office. These are pivotal to combat the outbreak, he explained.',\n",
       " '“Action usually speaks louder than words,” Dr. Wu said, adding that “most people are aware of how to maintain good health, but the tricky part is whether they can actually implement it.”',\n",
       " '“The president’s health exceeds the level of personal issues; it is, in effect, a national issue.”',\n",
       " 'After all, Dr. Wu stressed that when it comes to fighting the pandemic, everything is simple. You need to stay away from the virus, act for the greater good and actively protect yourself by wearing face masks, washing your hands, and keeping a safe social distance with others.',\n",
