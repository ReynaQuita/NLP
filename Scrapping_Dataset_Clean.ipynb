In fact, new items have been selling out within minutes of being available on the store’s website.',\n",
       " 'The decision to start selling products at a physical store comes in response to customer feedback, as not everyone, particularly those of the older generation, are familiar with shopping online. As such, in order to accommodate the different preferences of customers, the airline chose to offer an additional option for everyone to purchase the products.',\n",
       " 'The representative said that the in-person store will be open on Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and that there is no limit to the number of items a customer can purchase, even for the most popular ones that sell out quickly online.',\n",

They indicated that the airline adjusts the supply of their products based on demand, so customers can be assured that their desired items will be restocked as soon as possible.',\n",
       " 'Due to the coronavirus pandemic where almost all passenger flights are suspended, Starlux Airlines has turned to cargo operations and selling merchandise in order to maintain revenue.',\n",
       " 'Across the world, commercial planes have been parked on the ground. Airlines have suspended the majority of flights due to plummeting demand; many of those working in the aviation industry have been put on unpaid leave, or even worse, laid off permanently.',\n",
       " 'During these challenging and uncertain times for airline companies and their staff, it is inevitable that we ponder what flying will be like after the coronavirus pandemic is over. Would the airlines, which we have relied upon over the years, still be there?',\n",
       " 'Unfortunately, the truth is that no one knows for sure. There are too many factors that are simply unpredictable.',\n",
       " 'Here in Taiwan, authorities have done a phenomenal job limiting to contain the spread of the virus. But because health measures everywhere else are under different constraints, it is unlikely that international travel will return to pre-coronavirus levels any time soon.',\n",
       " 'Despite the various difficulties the aviation industry is facing, it can be argued that Taiwan’s aviation industry is in a good position to survive the coronavirus pandemic.',\n",
       " 'Firstly, it is fortunate that Taiwan’s three international airlines, Starlux, EVA, and China Airlines, were in a healthy financial situation before the coronavirus hit early this year.',\n",
       " 'EVA Air and China Airlines have been operating relatively efficiently for years and retain sufficient cash. Starlux Airlines, despite only commencing operations right before coronavirus hit, also has strong financial support from its investors, management, and even its own employees.',\n",
       " 'Contrary to all expectations, the airlines themselves have responded in creative ways to adapt to the current situation, and have turned to alternative ways to earn revenue.',\n",
       " 'Taiwan’s two largest airline groups, EVA and CAL, have focused their operations on domestic and cargo flights, where demand is surging. For example, they have deployed large international jets to operate short 40-minute domestic flights to Penghu, benefitting both customers and the airline themselves.',\n",
       " 'Starlux Airlines, on the other hand, has taken full advantage of the luxury startup airline’s fan base to sell merchandise and other Starlux-branded products. Recently, Starlux even expanded its incredibly popular online store to a physical location at the company’s headquarters.',\n",
       " 'But even if the airlines cannot sustain themselves in the long term, the airlines appear to have the government’s backing. For example, the government has pledged to help Taiwan’s carriers obtain loans of up to NT$50 billion if needed.',\n",
       " 'Such signs of government support suggest that the government is aware of the benefits that Taiwan’s airlines bring to the nation’s business, tourism and hospitality sectors. Therefore, in an event that a Taiwanese airline is at risk of collapsing, the government would likely step in with other forms of assistance.',\n",
       " 'Taiwan’s luxury international carrier, Starlux Airlines, recently reversed its decision to not operate domestic flights. In a statement to local media, the airline indicated that it now plans to launch charter flights to Kinmen, Penghu and Taitung, pending government approval.',\n",
       " 'This announcement is particularly surprising considering that Starlux decided against such plans a few weeks ago for many reasons. So, why was such a decision made back then?',\n",
       " 'Given that the aviation industry is dynamic in nature, particularly during uncertain times, airlines have to be quick and flexible in their decision making. Here is one crucial reason why Starlux may have changed its plans for the short-term future:鑑於大多數國際航班因新型冠狀病毒肺炎的大流行而被取消，世界上大多數飛機駕駛員可飛行的航班數量十分有限。Given that most international passenger flights have been canceled amid the coronavirus pandemic, the majority of the world’s pilots have had limited flights to operate.',\n",
       " 'However, in order for an airlines’ cockpit crew to retain their pilot licenses, they must meet international regulatory requirements such as regularly making takeoffs and landings.',\n",
       " 'To avoid having to “re-train” their pilots if their licenses are suspended due to inactivity, airlines strive to ensure that the minimum requirements for flight operations are met.',\n",
       " 'Such efforts can be costly; for example, South Korea’s Asiana Airlines has been flying empty A380s in order for the aircraft type’s cockpit crew to retain their licenses.',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, contrary to previous expectations, there appears to be no predictable end to the current crisis, with the current coronavirus ravaging countries across the globe. As such, it is wise for Starlux to adopt a short-term solution to address the issue of maintaining pilot certification.',\n",
       " 'Since it is in Starlux Airlines’ interest to maintain certified licenses for their cockpit crew, the company might as well earn revenue while Starlux’s pilots operate the necessary flights.',\n",
       " 'At the same time, while domestic flights may not be extremely profitable, passengers who experience Starlux’s well-appointed planes may be more inclined to choose the luxury airline over its competitors, when more profitable international flights return to normal.',\n",

In 1957, the couple began selling steamed dumplings and went through numerous trials and errors to develop the key dishes that have established their restaurant’s reputation.',\n",

       " 'According to Yang, it would take someone two to three years to perfect such skills. The reason why Xiao Long Bao is so hard to master is that it requires an exact ratio of ingredients and close attention to detail.',\n",
       " 'Yang explained that the time needed for the Xiao Long Bao to be at the perfect temperature is crucial and should be timed as accurately as possible. They need to be heated for around four and a half minutes, and if they are heated just ten seconds over time, they will crumble.',\n",
       " 'Many may wonder why the Xiao Long Bao is so craved for. According to Yang, people like the Xiao Long Bao for different reasons. He specified that the Japanese especially loved the simplicity of it.',\n",
       " 'Years ago, before Din Tai Fung became globalized, their main customers were Japanese, Chinese and Americans. Therefore, when Yang Bing-yi and Lai Pen-mai first opened the store, they only included Japanese, Chinese, and English in their brand name.',\n",
       " 'When Yang Bing-yi and Lai Pen-mei first came up with the idea of expanding Din Tai Fung abroad, they decided to first start with Japan.',\n",
       " 'Yang noticed the incredible sanitation and politeness that the Japanese displayed, and decided to emphasize the need for a clean environment that allows his customers to feel like home in his restaurant. Therefore, this common expectation is upheld in all of his restaurants.',\n",
       " 'Although the brand Din Tai Fung has expanded to 167 restaurants, the expectations, not only by the customers but by Yang himself, remain the same for each of them.',\n",
       " 'Yang pays close attention to the quality of his food and often dines in Din Tai Fung as well. According to him, his favorite dish is shrimp pancake (香酥蝦餅). The idea for shrimp pancakes came about when Yang visited Singapore.',\n",

       " '然而，即使長期來說這些航空公司自身會難以維持，他們仍有政府在背後支持。例如，台灣政府保證幫助台灣運輸業者，若有需要時可獲得高達五百億台幣的貸款。',\n",
